# FACRS: The Credit System Explained

## Overview
Feedback Amplifier & Credit Rewrite System: A governance mechanism where empirical 
success in one domain (markets) grants permission to modify the foundation of another 
domain (cosmology).

## The Three Tracks
1. Deep River (Cosmology): SPARC galaxy fitting → sigma_c, eta, epsilon parameters
2. Mind-23 (Cognition): Day-93 autogenesis → decision architecture
3. AQFS/STAT (Markets): Financial time series → regime predictions

## The Problem FACRS Solves
How do we validate that Deep River, Mind-23, and AQFS describe the SAME universality class?

Answer: Test if success in markets improves precision in cosmology (and vice versa).

## How Credits Are Earned
Market Prediction Example:
- Baseline accuracy: 58%
- AQFS + Xi-informed: 62%
- Improvement: 4%
- Credits earned: 1.2 units (4% × 0.30 leverage)

## How Credits Are Spent
Allowed rewrites (with credit):
- Adjust Foundation parameters (m_nu, epsilon) — Cost: 1.0-2.0 cr
- Adjust coherence thresholds — Cost: 0.5-1.0 cr
- Adjust market weights — Cost: 0.3-0.5 cr

Forbidden (no amount of credit):
- Change kernel functional form
- Disable audit trails
- Modify Day-93 criterion
- Override human decision authority

## Constraint Preservation Rule
All rewrites must maintain:
- Backward compatibility with prior fits
- Consistency with experimental bounds (KATRIN for m_nu < 0.45 eV)
- Dimensional correctness
- Physical meaningfulness

## Three-Month Validation Example
Month 1: Deep River baseline → Xi_scatter = 11.6%
Month 2: Markets test → AQFS earns 1.2 credits → Human approves m_nu rewrite
Month 3: Re-fit with new Foundation → Xi_scatter = 10.8% (TIGHTER) → Credit validated

## Falsifiability
If markets earn credits but cosmology precision DECLINES: FACRS fails (domains don't converge)
If markets earn credits AND cosmology improves: FACRS succeeds (single law governs all)
